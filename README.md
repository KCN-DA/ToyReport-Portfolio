# Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis with Power BI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This Power BI report analyzes **Mavin Toy's sales performance**, highlighting revenue trends, product performance, and store location insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
- **Source:** A total of four datasets were used the "Sales.csv", "Stores.csv", "Calendar.csv", "Products.csv" from

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Using Power BI connect to the Sales, Stores, Products, and Calendar csv files through Transform Data > New Source > Text/CSV 
- Review table columns, check for blank or null values, confirm that datatypes are accurately defined, and identify any primary and foreign keys
- Add calculated columns in the calendar table for â€˜start of monthâ€™ and â€˜start of weekâ€™
- Load the tables to the data model and create relationships from the sales table to the products, stores, and calendar tables
- Your model should take the form of a star schema, with 1:many relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Create a date hierarchy containing the â€˜start of monthâ€™, â€˜start of weekâ€™, and â€˜dateâ€™ fields
- Create calculated columns in the sales table to pull in â€˜costâ€™ and â€˜priceâ€™ from the products table, then use those fields to calculate revenue and profit for each transaction
- Create measures to calculate the count of orders (â€˜total ordersâ€™), sum of revenue (â€˜total revenueâ€™) and sum of profit (â€˜total profitâ€™)
- Add KPI card visuals showing â€˜total ordersâ€™, â€˜total revenueâ€™ and â€˜total profitâ€™ for the current month, along with monthly trends for each metric
- Add a slicer to filter the report page by store location and a bar chart showing â€˜total ordersâ€™ by product category, and a line chart showing â€˜total revenueâ€™ with the date hierarchy on the x-axis
- Assemble the charts into a logical layout and adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the report as you see fit

## DAX Function
Here are some DAX function or calculated columns that were used
1. Revenue = sales[Price] * sales[Units] 
2. Profit = sales[Revenue] - (sales[Cost] * sales[Units])
3. Total Order = DISTINCTCOUNT(sales[Sale_ID])
4. Total Profit = SUM(sales[Profit])
